'''''''''''''''''''''''''
promise - .then, catch

 async await:
 >To avoid the chaining process in react we are using async await
 >it will act as more synchronous manner
 > It is a feature of javaScript not React's

 '''''''''''''''''''''
 >only providing responses data(data we are asking),not getting other information code(Status code, url...)
 >wont support for all Browsers(Works only for some commonly used Browsers like Chrome,Edge)
 >very low Error handling capacity

 >Solution: Axios

 >It fullfill all the Drawbacks in using Fetch()
 >that is:
    - Provide all information about API call
    - support all Browsers
    - Faster and accurate
>basic methods in axios:-(http methods(CRUD))
    get - retrieve data
    post - create data
    patch - partially update 
    put - fully update
    delete - delete data
